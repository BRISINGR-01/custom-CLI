initializes a node project (similarly to 'npm init') by adding to a directory (default is the current one):

init.js             main node server
package.json    
public/             publically served folder
    index.html      landing page
    404.html
helpers             obligatory module for the init.js


or initializes a custom cli project for the `$main_command add` (see `$main_command add --help`) by creating a directory with:

a js/sh/cmd/ps1 file with the same name as the directory
a txt file with the same name



usage:
$main_command init (path to directory) (-y/--yes) (-k/--keep)
$main_command init cli (path to directory) (-y/--yes) (-k/--keep)

the order isn't important apart from `init cli`
() - optinal

flags:
-y/--yes            accept all suggestions at prompts 
-k/--keep           if there are existing files with those names, they will be not be overwritten
