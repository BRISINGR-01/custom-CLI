displays the inside structure of a folder in several ways

usage:
$main_command -s (number of spaces) (folderpath)
$main_command tree -s/-o/-j/-a (folderpath)
$main_command tree -f -s/-o/-j/-a (folderpath) (filepath)

** filepath - the path to the file where the output will be written
** folderpath - the path to the folder which will be dispayed (the current one is defalut)
** number of spaces - default is 2
all ** are optional

default:
$main_command tree => $main_command tree -s currentDir
$main_command tree -f => $main_command tree -fj currentDir currentDir/currentDir.json

the only important order is the folder and file paths at -f/--file
if there is -f/--file flag making an object, the values of the files will be the files' contents

flags:
-s/--spaces     the deeper a file/folder is, the more spaces it has in front of its name
-o/--object     display it as a js object
-j/--json       a stringified json version
-a/--array      display it as an array
-f/--file       the same, but instead of logged onto the console, it is written into a file
