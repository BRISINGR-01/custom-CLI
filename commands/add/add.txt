Adds a new functionality to the `$main_command` by adding another argument alongside the existing ones like init, tree, add, uninstall...

You can initialize this project with `$main_command init cli (-y/--yes)`

usage:
$main_command add (folder path)

*folder path - optional, current directory is default

The folder must be named the same as the new command. It must include a .js/.sh/.cmd/.ps1 file and a .txt file, both with the name of the new command
The .js/.sh/.cmd/.ps1 file is the one to be executed with all of the flags after calling `$main_command your_command`
The .txt file will be logged onto the console when you call your command with the `--help` flag. For example `$main_command --help your_command`. In this file you can use several variables which will be automatically replaced:
\$main_command => $main_command
\$clipath => $clipath
